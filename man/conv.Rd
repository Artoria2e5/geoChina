\title{Convert coordinates}
\usage{
conv(lat, lon, from = c("WGS-84", "GCJ-02", "BD-09"), to = c("WGS-84",
  "GCJ-02", "BD-09"), api = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{lat}{a numeric latitude}

\item{lon}{a numeric longitude}

\item{from}{the inputting GCS}

\item{to}{the outputting GCS}

\item{api}{use Baidu Maps API. Note that Baidu Maps API only supports the 
transformations from WGS-84 or GCJ-02 to BD-09. Other coodinate conversions 
must be done locally. As the conversion result is the same, it's recommended 
to perform conversions locally.}
}
\value{
a data.frame with variables lat/lng
}
\description{
the general function that converts lat/lon coordintes from one GCS to another 
GCS including WGS-84, GCJ-02 and BD-09 either locally or by calling Baidu 
Maps API.
}
\details{
note that the Baidu Maps API limits to 20 lat/lon coordinates per query. 
Since the coordinate conversion results of Baidu Maps API and local algorithms 
are the same, it is recommended to use local algorithms.
